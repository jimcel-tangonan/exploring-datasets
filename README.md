A compilation of examples showcasing the projects I've done using machine learning algorithms and data analysis.

#### 1. Selenium Webdriver - Instagram Automation
A python script to automate Instagram actions (i.e. commenting, liking, following) on user profiles with the goal of building influence. 

##### Script functions at ~125 profiles per 25 mins. 
  - Ignores all profiles that are private-users/less than 25 posts/non-english and must have a followers/following ratio of       0.1-100 (to determine profile status as influencer/microinfluencer/regular/spam).
  - Captures and stores IG username/other attributes for ML analysis.
  - Calculates followers/following ratio .
  - Determines if photo has been previously liked and if able, leaves a like or comment.
  - Follows profile when all criteria are met.
